# MajuPilot

MajuPilot is an evidence-backed Digital and AI Transformation advisor for Malaysian SMEs and the Exabytes advisory workflow. It turns a structured discovery interview into an inspectable Business Twin, deterministic diagnosis, capability-first recommendations, transformation scenarios, an advisor-reviewed Blueprint, a canonical private PDF, and a consented consultation handoff.

Production: <https://majupilot-exabytes.vercel.app/>

## What is implemented

- Five-step SME discovery with bounded, evidence-linked follow-up questions.
- Editable Business Twin with confidence and source provenance.
- Deterministic digital-maturity, AI-readiness, pain ranking, scenario, cost, value, and payback engines.
- Capability-first recommendations mapped to a versioned Exabytes catalogue.
- Live DeepSeek interpretation through Vercel AI Gateway, with strict schemas, budgets, safe telemetry, and deterministic fallbacks where permitted.
- Five evidence-bounded advisor perspectives and a 16-section Transformation Blueprint.
- Deterministic canonical PDF generation, private Supabase Storage, content hashes, and short-lived signed downloads.
- Immutable accepted consultant notes derived from reviewed drafts.
- Durable Supabase persistence, guest ownership, organization roles, tenant isolation, RLS, consent records, leads, deterministic assignment, audit events, and export/deletion request contracts.
- A persisted Transformation Copilot with typed reads and confirmation-gated, idempotent writes.
- An assessment-scoped private Evidence Library for bounded PDF, DOCX, and TXT uploads, with cited Copilot retrieval.
- A durable signed-webhook outbox with leasing, bounded retry, dead-letter handling, replay authorization, SSRF protection, and redacted delivery receipts.
- Responsive, keyboard-accessible interfaces plus three clearly labelled fictional demonstration cases.

Copilot answers from the persisted structured Business Twin, diagnosis, recommendations, scenarios, Blueprint, report, lead, and audit records. Uploaded documents add a separate, bounded and cited evidence source; unsupported or unanswerable document questions fail closed.

Models do not own scores, ranks, budgets, prerequisites, catalogue facts, ROI arithmetic, or persistence decisions. Those remain deterministic and versioned. Contact details are never sent to the model.

## Repository layout and the original project

This repository contains the complete inherited application, not a thin overlay. The accepted original project history is preserved in Git at tag `v1.0.0-baseline`, and the original remote is retained as the read-only `v1` remote. The application directory is still named `sme-growth-twin/` because renaming the internal root would add deployment and history risk without changing the product; all customer-facing surfaces are branded MajuPilot.

Managed Codex worktrees were temporary isolated checkouts used to implement and review phases safely. Their accepted commits were merged into this repository's `main` branch, so the authoritative current files are here. Large local sizes usually come from generated or ignored directories such as `node_modules/`, `.next/`, browser profiles, and evidence artifacts; Git stores source and required assets, not every generated dependency/cache copy.

## Run locally

Prerequisites: Node.js 22.12 or newer, npm, and the configured `sme-growth-twin/.env.local` file.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/desanv01/majupilot-exabytes.git
cd majupilot-exabytes\sme-growth-twin
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. Stop the server with `Ctrl+C`. On later runs, open a terminal in `sme-growth-twin/` and run only `npm run dev`; reinstall only when `package-lock.json` changes or `node_modules/` is absent.

Never commit `.env.local`. Only `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` may be browser-visible; all service, Gateway, webhook, and cron credentials are server-only.

## Focused quality commands

Run from `sme-growth-twin/`:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run lint` | ESLint checks |
| `npm run type-check` | Strict TypeScript checks |
| `npm test` | Deterministic unit and integration suite |
| `npm run build` | Production Next.js build |
| `npm run test:stage07:golden` | Exact fictional A/B/C outcomes |
| `npm run test:stage07:security` | Server/client and secret-boundary checks |
| `npm run audit:production` | High/critical production dependency gate |

## Delivery record

V2 phases A through I are accepted and merged. The authoritative implementation evidence, exact PRs, corrections, live-AI proof, security assertions, and phase acceptance notes are recorded in [the stage ledger](planning/MAJUPILOT-V2-STAGE-LEDGER.md). The original baseline remains reachable at tag `v1.0.0-baseline`.

## Security

- Secrets and real customer records must never be committed, logged, or used in demos.
- Product and benchmark claims require traceable sources.
- Consent is explicit and immutable; private report access is owner/role scoped.
- Versioned routes use strict input schemas, bounded bodies, no-store responses, and owner/role checks.
- Webhook delivery is HTTPS-only, HMAC-signed, DNS/IP constrained, retry-bounded, and receipt-redacted.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the supported status, disclosure route, controls, and operational limits.
